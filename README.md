## Background
Wrote a Python script to recover an animation in Blender with a corrupted camera. The automated script captured completed viewport renders, labeled them by frame number, and then advanced to the next frame.

The captured frames were rendered at a higher resolution than the rest of the sequence and then cropped to match the final animation. This resulted in multiple hours of animation time being saved.
